<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve just completed the <a href="/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/">5-Minute Installation</a> of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please <em>don&#8217;t change anything within the program</em> unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you&#8217;ll soon be changing everything.</p>

<p>Begin by logging into the administration area, or the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#back-end">back end</a>, of your website. Visit your site&#8217;s login page by placing <em>wp-admin</em> after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">themes</a> provide a login link or form on the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#front-end">front end</a> as well. Now login to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Start at the top</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15749836" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-300x171.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-768x437.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1536x875.png 1536w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-2048x1166.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After logging in you are on the main <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a> called the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a>.  This is where the organization of your site begins.</p>



<p>At the top of the screen is the area called the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together"><em>toolbar</em></a>. Click on your site name; it&#8217;s a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Don&#8217;t like it? Doesn&#8217;t matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Test drive your WordPress site</h2>



<p>Take time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress">how it all works</a>; it&#8217;s important to see how the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="838" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-–-Just-another-WordPress-site-1024x838.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15439030" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-–-Just-another-WordPress-site-1024x838.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-–-Just-another-WordPress-site-300x245.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-–-Just-another-WordPress-site-768x628.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-–-Just-another-WordPress-site.png 1354w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The layout you are looking at is defined by a <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">WordPress Theme</a>. It is the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog">appearance</a> of your website, styling the look of the site, and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme features a “header” at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below is your <a href="/support/article/appearance-menus-screen/">Menu</a>, if you have one. The main middle section of the page is the content area. </p>



<p>Scroll down the page and you will see a search box, recent posts, and recent comments. These are called <a href="/support/article/wordpress-widgets/">Widgets</a>. </p>



<p>Notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the “footer.” It says “Proudly powered by WordPress.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take a Quick Trip Around</h3>



<p>For now, you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your <em>home page</em> or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their <em>single</em> post pages to look different from the home page.</p>



<p>In the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?</p>



<p>All of these changes are created from a few files called <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/">template files</a>. You can learn more about how they work in <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Developer Handbook</a>. For now, however, let&#8217;s get on with how the rest of WordPress works.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Test Drive the WordPress Administration Screens</h2>



<p>Now that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it&#8217;s time to test drive the <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administering-your-blog/">WordPress Administration</a>. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a>, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15749836" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-300x171.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-768x437.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1536x875.png 1536w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-2048x1166.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a> features a list of the most recent activity you&#8217;ve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.</p>



<p>On the left side of the screen is the <strong>main navigation</strong> menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will “fly out” for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a “parent” navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.</p>



<p>The various menu items are as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central">Dashboard</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content">Posts</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#media-add-pictures-and-movies-to-your-posts">Media</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#pages-your-static-content">Pages</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#comments-reader-feedback">Comments</a></li>

<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings">Settings</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s start with the User screen</h3>



<p>Click on the <strong>Users</strong> tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#all-users">All Users</a> that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors&#8217; accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the Your Profile menu choice. This is where you will enter information about yourself, the author, and the <a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator">administrator</a> of the site. Fill in the information and click <strong>Update Profile</strong> when done.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="472" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-1024x472.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15439045" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-1024x472.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-300x138.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-768x354.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress.png 1362w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changing the Look</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="615" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-1024x615.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15439034" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-1024x615.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-300x180.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress-768x461.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-‹-myfirstwpsite-—-WordPress.png 1365w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br> The <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog">Appearance, Themes Screen</a> allows you to change the look of your site using different <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">Themes</a>. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together">toolbar</a> to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. It&#8217;s that easy. Go back to <strong>Appearance &gt; Theme</strong> and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="612" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626067-55fd593f-e477-479a-893d-495b84e6d67f-1024x612.jpg" alt="First time opening &quot;Create a post&quot; screen with welcome wizard.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a post</h3>



<p>Back in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>, take a look at the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens#all-posts">Posts Screen</a>. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to <a href="/support/article/wordpress-editor/">write and manage your posts</a>. Let&#8217;s start by making your first test post in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content">Add New</a> tab.</p>



<p>The first time you use the Block Editor, you will see a short tutorial.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="612" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-1024x612.png" alt="Edit post screen without any content." class="wp-image-16360191" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-1024x612.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-300x179.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-768x459.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e.png 1209w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Add the title of the article in the space allocated. Then write a text in the &#8220;<em>Start writing or type / to choose a block</em>&#8221; section This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click on the <strong>Publish</strong> button at the top right of the page, then click a second time to confirm the publication. Now that you&#8217;ve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens#toolbar">toolbar</a> at top of the screen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comments</h3>



<p>Part of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from <em>pats on the back</em> (<em>Good job! Like the post!</em>) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information you&#8217;ve posted. Responding to comments and <a href="/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/">moderating them</a> can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented.  You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site. When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the <a href="/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/">article on comments and WordPress discussion options</a> to help you set those features. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing Spam</h4>



<p>There is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately, we live in a world where <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam">spam</a> is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, <a href="/support/article/comment-spam/">Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam</a>. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create Categories</h3>



<p>Posts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but you will soon want more. In the <strong><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#categories">Posts &gt; Categories</a></strong> tab, in the <strong>Add New Category</strong> area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your <em>parent</em> categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#e9ebee"><strong>NOTE:</strong><em> You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you don&#8217;t want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting Up Your Site</h2>



<p>Before you get to the graphic look of your site, let&#8217;s do a little more administration to your site to set it up. You may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and don&#8217;t forget to activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Akismet WordPress Plugin</a> that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam. When you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull-down menu for Parent Category, you can select the <em>parent</em> to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage &gt; Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Computer Tips
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows</li>



<li>Linux</li>



<li>Mac</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Internet News</li>



<li>Web Page Design
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Web Standards</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>WordPress
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plugins</li>



<li>Themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Put Posts in Categories</h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Let&#8217;s put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works. From the <strong>Posts &gt; Category Screen</strong>, click on the tab for <strong><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#all-posts">All Posts</a></strong>. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View links. Click on Edit to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen, you will now see your Categories. Choose one of them by clicking on the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the <strong>Update</strong> button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category. Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together">toolbar</a> at the top of your <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>. Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the “missing” category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated <em>Category</em> page. Now, click on the <strong>Archives</strong> for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month &#8211; well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Next</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your site&#8217;s information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, don&#8217;t forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using WordPress Themes</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">WordPress Themes</a> to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience&#8217;s needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you don&#8217;t like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme. </p>

<p><a href="/support/article/plugins/">WordPress Plugins</a> are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to a simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem-solving. They are usually fairly <a href="/support/article/managing-plugins/">simple to install</a> through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin author&#8217;s website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you haven&#8217;t found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Above and Beyond the Basics</h2>



<p>The exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits. Thousands of people are using WordPress for blogging and for running their websites. For example, look at some of the entries under the <a href="https://wordpress.org/showcase/">WordPress.org Theme Showcase</a>. All have a different look and different functions on their sites. What you do from here is up to you, but here are a few places to take that first step beyond the basics: </p>

<p>Note: This page refers to WordPress using the older or Classic Editor. If you are on a new version of WordPress or using the block editor, refer to <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress-block-editor/">this page</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve just completed the <a href="/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/">5-Minute Installation</a> of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please <em>don&#8217;t change anything within the program</em> unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you&#8217;ll soon be changing everything.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Log In</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="396" height="518" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/login_form.png" alt="Login screen for WordPress" class="wp-image-10776355" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/login_form.png 396w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/login_form-229x300.png 229w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /></figure>



<p><br>Begin by logging in to the administration area, or the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#back-end">back end</a>, of your website. Visit your site&#8217;s login page by placing <em>wp-admin</em> after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">themes</a> provide a login link or form on the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#front-end">front end</a> as well. Now log in to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Start at the Top</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1903" height="1253" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png" alt="Dashboard ‹ Your Website — WordPress" class="wp-image-10776356" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png 1903w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-300x198.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1024x674.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-768x506.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1536x1011.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px" /></figure>



<p>After logging in you are on the main <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a> called the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a>.  This is where the organization of your site begins.</p>



<p>At the top of the screen is the area called the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together"><em>toolbar</em></a>. Click on your site name; it&#8217;s a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Don&#8217;t like it? Doesn&#8217;t matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Test Drive Your WordPress Site</h2>



<p>Take time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress">how it all works</a>; it&#8217;s important to see how the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="997" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x997.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11656811" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x997.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-300x292.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-768x748.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1536x1495.png 1536w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-2048x1994.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The layout you are looking at is defined by a <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">WordPress Theme</a>. It is the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog">appearance</a> of your website, styling the look of the site and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme features a “header” at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below this is your <a href="/support/article/appearance-menus-screen/">Menu</a>, if you have one. Along the side you will see some titles and links. This is the Sidebar. The different items inside a Sidebar are called <a href="/support/article/wordpress-widgets/">Widgets</a>. The main middle section of the page is the content area.</p>



<p>Scroll down the page and notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the “footer.” It says “Proudly powered by WordPress.”</p>



<p>Back to the sidebar, you will see different sections with information. Among these you may find a list of Recent Posts, Recent Comments, Archives, <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#categories">Categories</a>, links to the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screens</a>, Log Out, and RSS feeds. This is part of the menu or navigation Screen that people will use to move around your site, visiting posts from different categories or time periods.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take a Quick Trip Around</h3>



<p>For now you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your <em>home page</em> or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their <em>single</em> post pages to look different from the home page.</p>



<p>In the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?</p>



<p>All of these changes are created from a few files called <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/">template files</a>. You can learn more about how they work in <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Developer Handbook</a>. For now, however, let&#8217;s get on with how the rest of WordPress works.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Test Drive the WordPress Administration Screens</h2>



<p>Now that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it&#8217;s time to test drive the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administering_Your_Blog">WordPress Administration</a>. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a>, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1903" height="1253" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png" alt="Dashboard ‹ Your Website — WordPress" class="wp-image-10776356" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png 1903w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-300x198.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1024x674.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-768x506.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1536x1011.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px" /></figure>



<p>The <a href="/support/article/glossary/#dashboard">Dashboard</a> features a list of the most recent activity you&#8217;ve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.</p>



<p>On the left side of the screen is the <strong>main navigation</strong> menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will “fly out” for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a “parent” navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.</p>



<p>The various menu items are as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central">Dashboard</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content">Posts</a></li>



<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#media-add-pictures-and-movies-to-your-posts">Media</a></li>

<li><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings">Settings</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s start with the User screen</h3>



<p>Click on the <strong>Users</strong> tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#all-users">All Users</a> that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile">Your Profile</a> menu choice. This is where you will enter information about you, the author and <a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator">administrator</a> of the site. Fill in the information and click <strong>Update Profile</strong> when done.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1903" height="2356" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png" alt="Profile ‹ Your Website — WordPress" class="wp-image-10776365" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png 1903w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-242x300.png 242w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-827x1024.png 827w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-768x951.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1241x1536.png 1241w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1654x2048.png 1654w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px" /></figure>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changing the Look</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x640.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11656583" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x640.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen-300x188.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen-768x480.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen.png 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br> The <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog">Appearance, Themes Screen</a> allows you to change the look of your site using different <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">Themes</a>. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together">toolbar</a> to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. It&#8217;s that easy. Go back to <strong>Appearance &gt; Theme</strong> and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a post</h3>



<p>Back in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>, take a look at the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens#all-posts">Posts Screen</a>. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/support/article/writing-posts/" target="_blank">write and manage your posts</a>. Let&#8217;s start by making your first test post in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content">Add New</a> tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1903" height="1653" src="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png" alt="Add a New Post ‹ Your Website — WordPress" class="wp-image-10776370" srcset="https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress.png 1903w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-300x261.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1024x889.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-768x667.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-‹-Your-Website-—-WordPress-1536x1334.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px" /></figure>



<p>Simply fill in the blanks, one by one, in the post beginning with the title and then write a little test message in the post window. This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click the <strong>Publish</strong> button that is to the right of the post entry window and it is done.  There&#8217;s more exciting work ahead! Now that you&#8217;ve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens#toolbar">toolbar</a> at top of the screen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comments</h3>



<p>
Part of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from <em>pats on the back</em> (<em>Good job! Like the post!</em>) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information you&#8217;ve posted.

Responding to comments and <a href="/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/">moderating them</a> can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented.  You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site.

When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the <a href="/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/">article on comments and WordPress discussion options</a> to help you set those features.
</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing Spam</h3>



<p>
There is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately we live in a world where <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam">spam</a> is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam">Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam</a>.
</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create Categories</h3>



<p>Posts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but that will soon want more. In the <strong><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#categories">Posts &gt; Categories</a></strong> tab, in the <strong>Add New Category</strong> area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your <em>parent</em> categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><em>You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you don&#8217;t want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting Up Your Site</h2>



<p>
Before you get to the graphic look of your site, let&#8217;s do a little more administration to your site to set it up.

You may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and don&#8217;t forget to activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Akismet WordPress Plugin</a> that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam.

When you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull down menu for Parent Category, you can select the <em>parent</em> to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage &gt; Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Computer Tips
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows</li>



<li>Linux</li>



<li>Mac</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Internet News</li>



<li>Web Page Design
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Web Standards</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>WordPress
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plugins</li>



<li>Themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Put Posts in Categories</h3>



<p>
Let&#8217;s put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works.

From the <strong>Posts &gt; Category Screen</strong>, click on the tab for <strong><a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#all-posts">All Posts</a></strong>. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the <strong>Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View</strong> links. Click on <strong>Edit</strong> to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen you will now see your <strong>Categories</strong>. Choose one of them by clicking in the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the <strong>Update</strong> button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category.

Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together">toolbar</a> at the top of your <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>. Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the “missing” category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated <em>Category</em> page.

Now, click on the <strong>Archives</strong> for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month &#8211; well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information.
</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Next</h3>



<p>
You&#8217;ve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your site&#8217;s information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, don&#8217;t forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public!
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using WordPress Themes</h2>



<p>
There are hundreds of <a href="/support/article/using-themes/">WordPress Themes</a> to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience&#8217;s needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you don&#8217;t like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme.

<li><a href="/support/article/using-themes/">Using Theme</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating your own Theme</h3>



<p>
If you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs, or creating your own Theme.

<p><a href="/support/article/plugins/">WordPress Plugins</a> are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem solving. They are usually fairly <a href="/support/article/managing-plugins/">simple to install</a> through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin author&#8217;s website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you haven&#8217;t found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Above and Beyond the Basics</h2>



<p>
The exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits. Thousands of people are using WordPress for blogging and for running their websites. For example, look at some of the entries under the <a href="https://wordpress.org/showcase/">WordPress.org Theme Showcase</a>. All have a different look and different functions on their sites.

What you do from here is up to you, but here are a few places to take that first step beyond the basics:

<p>You are living in the age of technology, and you would have encountered terms like blogging, blog, and bloggers. People often need clarification about these terms. This document will discuss the concepts associated with blogging and explain the role of content and comments in the quality of blogging.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is blogging?</h2>



<p>Blogging deals with the regular sharing of information in the form of blogs on the internet. Understanding the blog concept is essential to get an insight into blogging.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a blog?</h2>



<p>A “blog” is an updated version of the old term “weblog,” used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse chronological order. Blogs range from personal to political and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.</p>



<p>Many blogs focus on web design, home staging, sports, mobile technology, etc. Few are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the author’s daily life and thoughts.</p>



<p>Generally speaking (although there are exceptions), blogs tend to have a few things in common:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A main content area with articles listed chronologically, the newest on top. Often, the articles are organized into categories—an archive of older articles.</li>



<li>A way for people to leave comments about the articles.</li>



<li>A list of links to other related sites is sometimes called a “blogroll.”</li>



<li>One or more “<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/">feeds</a>” like RSS, Atom, or RDF files.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some blogs may have additional features beyond these. Watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2I1pWXjXI">short video</a> for a simple explanation of what a blog is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a blogger?</h2>



<p>A blogger is a person who owns, runs, or maintains a blog. That is, posting articles or new posts, information, and sharing the most up-to-date news, opinions, and case studies, to name but a few.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The blog content</h2>



<p>Content has a central importance in any website. The nature of content depends on the type of business. Retail sites feature a catalog of products. University sites contain information about their campuses, curriculum, and faculty. News sites show the latest news stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A blogger should update the content regularly. You might have a bunch of observations or reviews for a personal blog. Without updated content, there is little reason to visit a website more than once.</p>



<p>Some blogs have a single author, and some have multiple authors. Each author writes his/her own articles. Typically, blog authors compose their articles in a web-based interface built into the blogging system. Some blogging systems also support using <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/weblog-client/">stand-alone “weblog client” software</a>, allowing authors to write articles offline and upload them later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comments</h2>



<p>Want an interactive website? Wouldn’t it be nice if a website&#8217;s readers could leave comments, tips, or impressions about the site or a specific article? With blogs, they can! Posting comments is one of the most exciting features of blogs. Most blogs have a method to allow visitors to <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging/#managing-comments">leave comments</a>. There are also nifty ways for authors of other blogs to leave comments without even visiting the blog! Called “<a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging/#pingbacks">pingbacks</a>” or “<a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging/#trackbacks">trackbacks</a>.“ They can inform other bloggers whenever they cite an article from another site in their own articles. It helps maintain online conversation painlessly among various site users and websites.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The difference between a blog and a CMS?</h2>



<p>Software that manages your website is commonly called a CMS or <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/Glossary/#content-management-system">“Content Management System</a>.” Many blogging software programs are considered a specific type of CMS. They provide the features required to create and maintain a blog. They can make publishing on the internet as simple as writing an article, giving it a title, and organizing it under (one or more) categories. While some CMS programs offer vast and sophisticated features, an essential blogging tool provides an interface where you can work in an easy and, to some degree, intuitive manner. At the same time, it handles the logistics involved in making your composition presentable and publicly available. In other words, you get to focus on what you want to write, and the blogging tool takes care of the rest of the site management.</p>



<p>WordPress is an advanced blogging tool that provides a rich set of <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-features/">features</a>. Through its <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>, you can set options for the behavior and presentation of your weblog. Via these <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screen</a>, you can easily compose a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary#post">blog post</a>, push a button, and be published on the internet instantly! WordPress takes great pains to see that your blog posts look good, the text looks beautiful, and the HTML code it generates conforms to web standards.</p>



<p>If you’re just starting, read <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/get-started-with-wordpress/">Getting Started with WordPress</a>, which contains information on how to get WordPress set up quickly and effectively and on performing basic tasks within WordPress, like creating new posts or editing existing ones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blogging tips</h2>



<p>Starting a new blog is complex and can put many people off. Some may get off to a good start only to become quickly discouraged because of the lack of comments or visits. You want to stand out from this crowd of millions of bloggers and be one of the few hundred thousand blogs that are visited. Here are some simple tips to help you on your way to blogging mastery:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Post regularly, but don’t post if you have nothing worth posting about.</li>



<li>Stick with only a few specific genres to talk about.</li>



<li>Don’t put ‘subscribe’ and ‘vote me’ links all over the front page until you have people that like your blog enough to ignore them (they’re usually just in the way).</li>



<li>Use a clean and simple theme.</li>



<li>Enjoy a blog for fun, and comment on other peoples’ blogs (as they usually visit back).</li>



<li>Have fun blogging, and remember, there are no rules to what you post on your blog!</li>
</ol>

<p class="has-white-color has-deep-blueberry-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-89407259ecdc93d26f85dc0cffcfce4a"><strong>Important:</strong> Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/welcome/">Support forums</a>.</p>



<p>WordPress help is never hard to find. There are many sites dedicated to helping WordPress users, including this support page and the always-helpful <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums/">forums</a>. With so much content available, however, how are you to know where to begin looking for help?</p>



<p>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ">WordPress FAQ</a>, which provides comprehensive answers to common questions, is a good place to start. You could also read our document on <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/welcome/">using the WordPress forums</a> to help you get better results from your support requests.</p>



<p>However, the best place to start looking for WordPress help is your favorite search engine. This is usually the quickest way to get the information you need, and helps take some of the pressure off our volunteers in the support forums.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Searching The Net For WordPress Help</h2>



<p>When searching online for WordPress help, one of the biggest challenges can be figuring out the right keywords to use. Otherwise, you risk spending an inordinate amount of time sorting through search results that don&#8217;t accurately reflect the problem that you are currently experiencing. In order to quickly get the information that you need, it makes sense to limit your search to specific online WordPress resources or websites. The following section will show you how to choose the right search terms, and how to use those terms effectively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Search Using Keywords</h3>



<p>Sometimes you can use error messages to generate the keywords needed in your help search. For example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Warning: main(/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/
functions.php): failed to open stream: No such
file or directory in /home/stargateatlantis/
public_html/wp-settings.php on line 67

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required
'/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/
functions.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:
/usr/local/lib/php') in /home/stargateatlantis/
public_html/wp-settings.php on line 67</pre>



<p>The keywords you need to help solve the problem are hidden within this information. In particular, the error specifically references the files that are causing the issue: functions.php and wp-settings.php. The names of these files will make up part of your search.</p>



<p>You could try opening the files directly to examine them. However, this may be of limited use. Due to the way that WordPress processes .php files, the given line numbers may not correspond to the actual source of the error.</p>



<p>The specific errors are <strong>failed to open stream</strong> and <strong>failed opening required</strong>, with both happening inside the wp-settings.php file. This indicates that the problem is likely with wp-settings.php rather than functions.php. The fact that both errors contain the words &#8220;failed&#8221; and &#8220;open&#8221; is another clue.</p>



<p>Armed with this information, create a search in your favorite search engine that includes the words:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wordpress failed open wp-settings.php
</pre>



<p>This should get you started on narrowing down the problem.</p>



<p>Not all keywords can be found so easily. If the problem is a CSS or HTML issue, you can include the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_Your_CSS_Styles">specific tag</a> or selector with which the problem seems to lie. However, it is still advisable to include actual words in your search, as it can be difficult to figure out which tag is causing the actual issue.</p>



<p>You may need to analyze the problem for a minute or two to in order to find the right terms. For example, if your web page layout looks noticeably different in Internet Explorer than it does in another browser, then search for information on <strong>Internet Explorer layout bugs</strong>. On the other hand, if you have a layout error that remains consistent among browsers, identify the part of the layout that is affected. Is it the <strong>sidebar</strong>, <strong>header</strong>, <strong>post content</strong>, or <strong>comments</strong>? Likewise, if the header image is not showing up or is not displaying correctly, begin by searching for <strong>wordpress header image</strong> and then add specifics such as <strong>wordpress header image missing</strong> to narrow things down.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brainstorming Search Terms</h3>



<p>Brainstorming is a useful technique to use if you are struggling to find suitable keywords. To start, write down the problem you are experiencing, trying to be as descriptive as possible. For example:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>I&#8217;m having trouble with the nested list in the sidebar of my layout. It isn&#8217;t lining up the items under the titles right. It is keeping things on the left margin when I want them to be indented.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Your description can be a good source of potential keywords. In the above example, you can find:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>sidebar</li>



<li>layout</li>



<li>nested list</li>



<li>left margin</li>



<li>indented</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these terms could be used as search keywords.</p>



<p>Alternatively, explain your problem to a non-WordPress user. Stating the issue in simple terms is an excellent way to get to the heart of a problem and find the right keywords to summarize the issue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Search Engine Site Search</h3>



<p>Once you have selected your keywords, it&#8217;s time to put them to work. As you sort through the search results, you may end up replacing your initial keywords with more specific ones, in order to narrow down the results. For example, while searching for &#8220;wordpress sidebar layout nested links&#8221;, you may discover that the problem lies within the specific <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes">theme</a> you are using. Add the name of the theme to your keywords in order to narrow down your search.</p>



<p>Another way to improve the quality of your search results is to search a specific site, rather than the entire internet. Most search engines allow you to run a search across one specific web address, helping you to avoid irrelevant results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Google, Yahoo, and Bing Site Search</h4>



<p>Google, Yahoo, and Bing all support use of the &#8220;site:&#8221; function while searching. To search a specific domain via one of these search engines, type your keywords and specify the site you want to search using the format &#8220;site:[domain]&#8221;. For example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">keyword1 keyword2 site:wordpress.org
</pre>



<p>This instructs the search engine to search all <strong>wordpress.org</strong> sites, such as <em>codex.wordpress.org</em>, <em>wordpress.org/support</em>, and <em>make.wordpress.org</em>.</p>



<p>To narrow your search down to a specific site, such as <em>codex.wordpress.org</em>, enter:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">keyword1 keyword2 site:codex.wordpress.org
</pre>



<p>This instructs the search engine to search only the codex.wordpress.org site, which won&#8217;t include results from the Support Forums.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other Search Engines</h4>



<p>Other search engines provide different ways to narrow down searches. Check to see if there is an advanced search option for your favorite search engine, and take your search from there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Quotes to Group Keywords</h3>



<p>You can narrow your search by grouping different keywords together. For example, instead of looking for:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sidebar layout nested list left margin indented</pre>



<p>you could group key phrases together with quote marks:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sidebar layout "nested list" "left margin" indented</pre>



<p>This would limit your search to anything with the words <em>sidebar</em>, <em>layout</em>, and <em>indented</em>, and the phrases &#8220;<em>nested list</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>left margin</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Most search engines also allow you to use Boolean references such as <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong> and <strong>NOT</strong> to group keywords together. For example, searching for:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">"left margin" OR "nested list"</pre>



<p>would return a list of pages containing either the phrase <em>&#8220;left margin&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;nested list&#8221;</em>, as well as pages containing both of those terms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WordPress Sources for Help</h2>



<p>The best way to find accurate and concise WordPress information is to get it directly from WordPress.org sites. The main places to go for WordPress help and support are:</p>

<p>This document is designed to offer definitions of various terms, exclusive to WordPress, that users may not be familiar with.</p>



<p>If you are a contributor, <strong>please</strong> don&#8217;t add definitions for generic terms (API, PHP, JavaScript, etc&#8230;).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="absolute-path">Absolute Path</h2>



<p><em>(also known as a <strong>full path</strong>)</em>
</p>



<p>The complete location of a file or directory within a computer filesystem.  An absolute path starts at the root directory (or drive letter) and continues up the directory hierarchy until the specific file or directory is reached.  This contrasts with a <a href="#relative-path">relative path</a>, which does not start at the root directory.</p>



<p>The syntax of absolute paths differs by operating system. On Microsoft Windows, they begin with a drive letter and use a backslash to separate directory names. Absolute paths on macOS and Linux lack drive letters and use a forward slash as the directory separator.</p>



<p>Examples:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Windows: <code>C:\Users\Matt\www\blog\images\icecream.jpg</code></li>



<li> macOS: <code>/Users/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg</code></li>



<li> Linux: <code>/home/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg</code></li>
</ul>



<p>To find the absolute filesystem path of the directory containing a web page, copy the code below into a new text file, save the file as <em>path.php</em> (thus making a simple PHP web page), and move that file to your <a href="#web-server">web server</a>. Then direct your web browser to the <a href="#url">URL</a> address of that file (e.g. <em><a href="http://www.example.com/path.php">http://www.example.com/path.php</a></em>).</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;?php
echo getcwd();
?&gt;
</pre>



<p>See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)">Path (computing) at Wikipedia</a>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="absolute-uri">Absolute URI</h2>



<p><em>(also known as a <strong>full URI</strong>)</em>
</p>



<p>A URI that contains the complete location of a resource (as opposed to a <a href="#relative-uri">relative URI</a>).</p>



<p>Examples:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> <code>http://www.example.com/blog/images/icecream.jpg</code></li>



<li> <code>ftp://ftp.example.com/users/h/harriet/www/</code></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="action">Action</h2>



<p>In WordPress; an Action is a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp">PHP function</a> that is executed at specific points throughout the WordPress Core.
</p>



<p>Developers can create a <strong>custom</strong> Action using the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action">Action API</a> to add or remove code from an existing Action by specifying any <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference">existing Hook</a>. This process is called &#8220;<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook">hooking</a>&#8220;.
</p>



<p><strong>For example:</strong> A developer may want to <strong>add</strong> code to the footer of a Theme. This could be accomplished by writing new function, then Hooking it to the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_footer">wp_footer</a> Action.
</p>



<p><strong>Custom Actions differ from custom <em><a href="#filter">Filters</a></em></strong> because custom Actions allow you to <strong>add or remove</strong> code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to <strong>replace</strong> specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="admin-bar">Admin Bar</h2>



<p>An area of the screen just above your site that gives you quick
access to features such as adding a new post or editing your profile.
It is only visible if you are logged in.
</p>



<p>The admin bar concept was added to WordPress in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.1">Version 3.1</a> and was replaced by the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Toolbar">Toolbar</a> in WordPress <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3">Version 3.3</a>.  To turn it on (or off), open the Dashboard and navigate to <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration</a> &gt; <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile">Users</a> &gt; <a href="/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/">Your Profile</a>.</p>

<li> See also: <a href="/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/">Your Profile Screen</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ajax">Ajax</h2>



<p><strong>Ajax</strong>&nbsp;is a technique that web pages use to have the server perform certain processing without reloading the web page. For example, when you approve a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses Ajax to change the comment&#8217;s status, and you see the change without having to reload the Comments screen.</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="apache">Apache</h2>



<p><strong>Apache</strong> is short for <strong><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server Project</a></strong>, a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available open source HTTP <a href="#web-server">Web server</a> software produced by the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>. It is the most commonly used web server on the internet, and is available on many platforms, including Windows, <a href="#unix">Unix</a>/<a href="#linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="#mac-os-x">Mac OS X</a>. Apache serves as a great foundation for publishing WordPress-powered sites.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="api">API</h2>



<p>Please refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Wikipedia page</a> for a definition. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="array">Array</h2>



<p>An <strong>array</strong> is one of the basic data structures used in computer programming.  An <em>array</em> contains a list (or <em>vector</em>) of items such as numeric or string values.  <em>Arrays</em> allow programmers to randomly access data.  Data can be stored in either <em>one-dimensional</em> or <em>multi-dimensional arrays</em>.
</p>



<p>A one-dimension array seven (7) elements would be:
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>105</th><th>200</th><th>54</th><th>53</th><th>102</th><th>13</th><th>405
</th></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags">Template Tag</a> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories">wp_list_categories()</a> uses a one-dimensional array for the &#8216;exclude&#8217; parameter.
</p>



<p>An example of two-dimensional array, 7 by 3 elements in size, would be:
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>105</th><th>200</th><th>54</th><th>53</th><th>102</th><th>13</th><th>405
</th></tr><tr><th>15</th><th>210</th><th>14</th><th>513</th><th>2</th><th>2313</th><th>4512
</th></tr><tr><th>501</th><th>500</th><th>499</th><th>488</th><th>552</th><th>75</th><th>1952
</th></tr></tbody></table></figure>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ascii">ASCII</h2>



<p><strong>ASCII</strong> (pronounced as &#8220;ask ee&#8221;) is a standard but limited <a href="#character-set">character set</a> containing only English letters, numbers, a few common symbols, and common English punctuation marks. WordPress <a href="#content">content</a> is not restricted to ASCII, but can include any <a href="#unicode">Unicode</a> characters.</p>



<p>ASCII is short for <strong>A</strong>merican <strong>S</strong>tandard <strong>C</strong>ode for <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>I</strong>nterchange.

<li> External links: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom (standard) at Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attribute-sources">Attribute sources</h2>



<p>An object describing the attributes shape of a block. The keys can be named as most appropriate to describe the state of a block type. The value for each key is a function which describes the strategy by which the attribute value should be extracted from the content of a saved post’s content. When processed, a new object is created, taking the form of the keys defined in the attribute sources, where each value is the result of the attribute source function.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attributes">Attributes</h2>



<p>The object representation of the current state of a block in post content. When loading a saved post, this is determined by the attribute sources for the block type. These values can change over time during an editing session when the user modifies a block, and are used when determining how to serialize the block.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="autosave">Autosave</h2>



<p>When you are writing or editing your posts and pages, the changes you
 make are automatically saved every 2 minutes. In the lower right corner
 of the editor, you’ll see a notification of when the entry was last
saved to the database.
Autosaves are automatically enabled for all posts and pages. There is
only one autosave for each post/page. Each new autosave overwrites the
previous autosave in the database.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="back-end">Back End</h2>



<p>The back end is the area that authorized users can sign into to add,
remove and modify content on the website. This may also be referred to
as “WordPress”, &#8220;admin&#8221; or “the administration area”.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="binaries">Binaries</h2>



<p><strong>Binaries</strong> refer to compiled computer programs, or executables. Many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> projects, which can be re-compiled from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a>, offer pre-compiled binaries for the most popular platforms and operating systems.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block">Block</h2>



<p>The abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage. The idea combines concepts of what in WordPress today we achieve with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-inserter-library">Block (Inserter) Library</h2>



<p>Primary interface for selecting from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/">available blocks</a>, triggered by plus icon buttons on Blocks or in the top-left of the editor interface.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-categories">Block categories</h2>



<p>These are not a WordPress taxonomy, but instead used internally to sort blocks in the Block Library.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-name">Block name</h2>



<p>A unique identifier for a block type, consisting of a plugin-specific namespace and a short label describing the block’s intent. e.g. <code>core/image</code></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-styles">Block styles</h2>



<p>The CSS styles that are part of the block, either via its stylesheet or via the block markup itself. For example, a class attached to the block markup is considered block styles. </p>



<p>Compare to <em><strong>Global Styles</strong></em>. In contraposition to Global Styles, block styles are sometimes referred to as <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#local-styles">Local Styles</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-supports">Block supports</h2>



<p>An API for blocks to declare what features they support. By declaring support for a feature, the API would add additional <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#attributes">attributes</a> to the block and matching UI controls for most of the existing block supports. </p>



<p>See <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/">Block Supports reference documentation</a> for a deep dive into the API.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-template-parts">Block Template parts</h2>



<p>Building on Block Templates, these parts help set structure for reusable items like a Footer or Header that one typically sees in a WordPress site. They are primarily site structure and are never to be mixed with the post content editor. With Full Site Editing and block based themes, users can create their own arbitrary Template Parts, save those in the database for their site, and re-use them throughout their site. Template parts are equivalent – in blocks – of theme template parts. They are generally defined by a theme first, carry some semantic meaning (could be swapped between themes such as a header), and can only be inserted in the site editor context (within “templates”).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-templates">Block Templates</h2>



<p>A template is a predefined arrangement of blocks, possibly with predefined attributes or placeholder content. You can provide a template for a post type, to give users a starting point when creating a new piece of content, or inside a custom block with the&nbsp;<code><strong>InnerBlocks</strong></code>&nbsp;component. At their core, templates are simply HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy, for example index, single or archive. This helps control the front-end defaults of a site that are not edited via the Page Editor or the Post Editor. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-templates/">templates documentation</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-themes">Block Themes</h2>



<p>A theme built in block forward way that allows Full Site Editing to work. The core of a block theme are its block templates and block template parts. To date, block theme templates have been HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-type">Block type</h2>



<p>In contrast with the blocks composing a particular post, a block type describes the blueprint by which any block of that type should behave. So while there may be many images within a post, each behaves consistent with a unified image block type definition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="blog">Blog</h2>



<p>A <strong>blog</strong>, or <strong>weblog</strong>, is an online journal, diary, or serial published by a person or group of people.
</p>



<p>Blogs are commonly used by individuals, peer groups, companies, or organizations.</p>



<p>Blogs often contain public as well as private content. Depending on the functionality of the <a href="#content-management-system">CMS</a>  software that is used, some authors may restrict access — through the  use of accounts or passwords — to content that is too personal to be  published publicly. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="blogging">Blogging</h2>



<p><strong>Blogging</strong> is the act of writing in one&#8217;s blog. To <em>blog</em> something is to write about something in one&#8217;s blog. This sometimes involves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">linking</a> to something the author finds interesting on the internet.
</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="blogroll">Blogroll</h2>



<p>A <strong>blogroll</strong> is a list of links to various blogs or news sites. Often a blogroll is &#8220;rolled&#8221; by a service which tracks updates (using <a href="#feed">feeds</a>)  to each site in the list, and provides the list in a form which  aggregates update information. The default blogroll (aka links) included  in WordPress was removed in version 3.5. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="category">Category</h2>



<p>Each <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">post</a> in WordPress can be filed under one or more <strong>categories</strong>.  Thoughtful categorization allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content and aids in the navigation of a site.
</p>



<p>Please note that a <strong>post</strong> category should not be confused with a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Link_Categories"><strong>link</strong> category</a>, which is used to classify and manage <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Links_-_Putting_the_Inter_in_the_Internet">links</a>.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>



<p>A <strong>capability</strong> is permission to perform one or more types of
task. Each user of a WordPress site might have some permissions but not
others, depending on their <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Role">role</a>.
 For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to
edit their own posts (the &#8220;edit_posts&#8221; capability), but not permission
to edit other users&#8217; posts (the &#8220;edit_others_posts&#8221; capability).
WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its
role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cgi">CGI</h2>



<p><strong>CGI</strong> (Common Gateway Interface) is a specification for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side">server-side</a> communication scripts designed to transfer information between a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server">web server</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side">web-client (browser)</a>.  Typically, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a> pages that collect data via forms use <em>CGI</em> programming to process the form data once the client submits it.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="character-entity">Character Entity</h2>



<p>A <strong>character entity</strong> is a method used to display <em>special characters</em> normally <em>reserved</em> for use in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a>.  For example, the <em>less than</em> (<strong>&lt;</strong>) and <em>greater than</em> (<strong>&gt;</strong>) are used as part the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a> tag structure, so both symbols are <em>reserved</em> for that use.  But, if you need to display those symbols on your site, you can use <em>character entities</em>.  For example:

use <strong><code>&amp;lt;</code></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;for the less than (&lt;) symbol
use <strong><code>&amp;gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;for the greater than (&gt;) symbol
</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="character-set">Character Set</h2>



<p>A <strong>character set</strong> is a collection of symbols (letters, numbers,
punctuation, and special characters), when used together, represent
meaningful words in a language.  Computers use an encoding scheme so
members of a character set are stored with a numeric value (e.g. 0=A,
1=B, 2=C, 3=D).  In addition, a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Collation">collation</a> determines the order (i.e alphabetic) to use when sorting the character set.
</p>



<p>By default, WordPress uses the Unicode UTF-8 (<strong>utf8</strong>) character set for the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description">WordPress MySQL database tables</a> created during the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">installation process</a>.  Beginning with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.2">Version 2.2</a>, the database character set (and collation) is defined in the <em>wp-config.php</em> file.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="collation">Collation</h2>



<p><strong>Collation</strong> refers to the order used to sort the letters, numbers, and symbols of a given <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Character_set">character set</a>.  For example, because WordPress, by default, uses the UTF-8 (<strong>utf8</strong>) character set, and when the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description">WordPress MySQL database tables</a> are created during the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">installation process</a>, MySQL assigns <strong>utf8_general_ci</strong> collation to those tables.  Beginning with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.2">Version 2.2</a>, the collation (and character set) used by WordPress is defined in the <em>wp-config.php</em> file.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="comments">Comments</h2>



<p><strong>Comments</strong> are a feature of <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog">blogs</a> which allow readers to respond to <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">posts</a>. Typically readers simply provide their own thoughts regarding the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content">content</a> of the post, but users may also provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a> to other resources, generate discussion, or simply compliment the author for a well-written post.
</p>



<p>You can control and regulate comments by filters for language and
 content. Comments can be queued for approval before they are visible on
 the web site. This is useful in dealing with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam">comment spam</a>.

 This is separate from the structural design of a web site, which
provides a framework into which the content is inserted, and the
presentation of a site, which involves graphic design. A <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content_Management_System">Content Management System</a> changes and updates content, rather than the structural or graphic design of a web site.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="database-version">Database version</h2>



<p>In WordPress, the <strong>database version</strong> is a number that increases every time changes are made to the way WordPress organizes the data in its <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#database">database</a>. It is not the same as the version of the database software, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL">MySQL</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB">MariaDB</a>.
</p>



<p>For example, the database version in WordPress 3.3 was 19470, and
 the database version in WordPress 3.3.1 did not change. This tells
anyone planning to use backed-up data from the older version that they
do not need to check for changes in the structure of the data.
</p>



<p>WordPress stores its database version in the database, as the
option named &#8220;db_version&#8221; in every WordPress site&#8217;s &#8220;wp_options&#8221; table.
(The table name prefix &#8220;wp_&#8221; may be missing or different in some cases.)

name system (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#DNS">DNS</a>) maps the domain name to a server&#8217;s <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address">IP address</a>. For example, the domain name <em>example.com</em> maps to the IP address <em>192.0.43.10</em>.
 Many domain names can map to the same IP address, allowing a single
server to run many websites. For example, the domain names <em>www.example.com</em> and <em>example.net</em> also map to the IP address <em>192.0.43.10</em>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dynamic-block">Dynamic block</h2>



<p>A type of block where the content of which may change and cannot be determined at the time of saving a post, instead calculated any time the post is shown on the front of a site. These blocks may save fallback content or no content at all in their JavaScript implementation, instead deferring to a PHP block implementation for runtime rendering.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="excerpt">Excerpt</h2>



<p>An <strong>excerpt</strong> is a condensed description of your blog <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">post</a> and refers to the summary entered in the Excerpt field of the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels">Administration</a> &gt; <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Add_New_Post">Posts</a> &gt; <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Add_New_SubPanel">Add New SubPanel</a>.  The <em>excerpt</em> is used to describe your post in RSS feeds and is typically used in displaying search results. The <em>excerpt</em> is sometimes used in displaying the <strong>Archives</strong> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category">Category</a> views of your posts.  Use the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags">Template Tag</a> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_excerpt">the_excerpt()</a>
 to display the contents of this field.  Note that if you do not enter
information into the Excerpt field when writing a post, and you use <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_excerpt">the_excerpt()</a> in your theme template files, WordPress will automatically display the first 55 words of the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">post</a>&#8216;s content.
</p>



<p>An <em>excerpt</em> should not be confused with the <strong>teaser</strong>, which refers to words before the <code>
&lt;!--more--&gt;
</code> in a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">post&#8217;s</a> content. When typing a long post you can insert the <code>
&lt;!--more--&gt;
</code> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Add_New_SubPanel#Visual_Versus_HTML_Editor">Quicktag</a> after a few sentences to act as a cut-off point.  When the post is displayed, the <strong>teaser</strong>, followed by a hyperlink (such as <strong>Read the rest of this entry&#8230;</strong>), is displayed.  Your visitor can then click on that link to see the full version of your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">post</a>. The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags">Template Tag</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_content">the_content()</a> should be used to display the teaser.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="feed">Feed</h2>



<p>A <strong>feed</strong> is a function of special software that allows
&#8220;Feedreaders&#8221; to access a site automatically looking for new content and
 then posting the information about new content and updates to another
site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and
hottest information posted on different blogging sites.  Some Feeds
include RSS (alternately defined as &#8220;Rich Site Summary&#8221; or &#8220;Really
Simple Syndication&#8221;), Atom or RDF files.  Dave Shea, author of the web
design weblog <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Mezzoblue</a> has written <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/19/what_is_rssx/">a comprehensive summary</a> of feeds.  Feeds generally are based on <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#XML">XML</a> technology.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="feed-reader">Feed Reader</h2>



<p>The role of Feedreader is to gather and display the webfeed from various website to one place.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="filter">Filter</h2>



<p>In WordPress, a Filter is a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp">function</a> that is associated with an existing <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action">Action</a> by specifying any <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference">existing Hook</a>.
</p>



<p>Developers can create <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter"><strong>custom</strong> Filters</a> using the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference">Filter API</a> to <strong>replace</strong> code from an existing Action. This process is called &#8220;<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook">hooking</a>&#8220;.
</p>



<p><strong>Custom Filters differ from custom <em><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action">Actions</a></em></strong> because custom Actions allow you to <strong>add or remove</strong> code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to <strong>replace</strong> specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="footer-area">Footer area</h2>



<p>A <strong>footer area</strong> is a horizontal area provided by a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Theme">theme</a> for displaying information other than the main <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content">content</a> of the web page. Themes may provide one or more footer areas below the content. Footer areas usually contain <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Widget">widgets</a> that an administrator of the site can customize.
</p>



<p>In a theme, footer areas are generated by a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Template">template</a> file, typically named <em>sidebar-footer.php</em>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ftp">FTP</h2>



<p><strong>FTP</strong>, or <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong>, is a client-server
protocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and
the most common way to upload files to a server.
</p>



<p>An FTP <em>client</em> is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP <em>server</em>.
</p>



<p>You may need to use an FTP client to upload your WordPress files to your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server">web server</a>, particularly if you use a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider">hosting provider</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="full-site-editing-or-fse">Full Site Editing or FSE</h2>



<p>This refers to a collection of features that ultimately allows users to edit their entire website using blocks as the starting point. This feature set includes everything from block patterns to global styles to templates to design tools for blocks (and more). First released in WordPress 5.9.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gallery">Gallery</h2>



<p>As defined by Andy Skelton, <strong>Gallery</strong>, introduced with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.5">WordPress 2.5</a>,
 is specifically an exposition of images attached to a post.  In that
same vein, an upload is &#8220;attached to a post&#8221; when you upload it while
editing a post.
</p>



<p>In the uploader there is a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; tab that shows all the
uploads attached to the post you are editing. When you have more than
one attachment in a post, you should see at the bottom of the Gallery
tab a button marked &#8220;Insert gallery&#8221;. That button inserts a shortcode
&#8220;&#8221; into the post. WordPress replaces that shortcode with an
exposition of all images attached to that post. Non-image file types are
 excluded from the gallery.
</p>



<p>Note: If you don&#8217;t see the &#8220;Insert gallery&#8221; button, it may be because you have not attached two images to the post.
</p>



<p>The pretty URLs for attachments are made only after you have published the post and should be composed as the post <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#permalink">permalink</a> plus the attachment <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#slug">slug</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gettext">gettext</h2>



<p>The <strong>gettext</strong> system is a set of tools and standards for
language translation, used by WordPress to provide versions in many
languages. In WordPress a text string for translation may have a domain
and a context. For example, a plugin might specify its own domain for
translations, and a context might help translators to provide different
translations of the same English word or phrase in different parts of
the user interface.

other time zones were measured. It has been replaced by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#UTC">UTC</a>
 (&#8220;Universal Time, Coordinated&#8221;), but for most practical purposes UTC
and GMT are the same, so the term GMT is still commonly used.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gutenberg">Gutenberg</h2>



<p>Gutenberg is newly developed, block-oriented editor. It uses blocks
to create all types of content, replacing a half-dozen inconsistent ways
 of customizing WordPress, bringing it in line with modern coding
standards, and aligning with open web initiatives. These content blocks
transform how users, developers, and hosts interact with WordPress to
make building rich web content easier and more intuitive, democratizing
publishing — and work — for everyone, regardless of technical ability.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hack">Hack</h2>



<p>A <strong>hack</strong> is a bit of code written to customize or extend the
functionality of a software product. Older versions of WordPress used a
hack-based extension system, but versions <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/1.2">1.2</a> and above of WordPress use a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API">Plugin API</a> with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook">hooks</a> for extensions.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hacking">Hacking</h2>



<p><strong>Hacking</strong> is the process of writing code for, or contributing code to, a piece of software.
</p>



<p>There is some controversy surrounding the meaning of this term.
It began as a benign term meaning &#8220;to exercise proficiency&#8221; or &#8220;to alter
 or improve,&#8221; but the popular media have since construed it to mean &#8220;to
break into a computer system, usually with malicious intent.&#8221; Many in
the computer industry have recently begun trying to &#8216;take back&#8217; the word
 from its popular mutation, and many have adopted the term <em>cracking</em>
 to replace the malicious interpretation. Because of the desire to
reclaim the word, you will often find the term used in conjunction with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> projects, intended in its benign form. For more information about the history of the term, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">Wikipedia&#8217;s article on <em>Hacker</em></a>.

</p>



<p>Because Hooks are required by Actions and Filter you may hear the
 phrase &#8220;Action Hooks&#8221; and &#8220;Filter Hooks&#8221; used from time to time.
</p>



<p>In technical and strict terms: a Hook is an event, i.e. event as understood by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer pattern</a>, invoked by the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_action">do_action()</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/apply_filters">apply_filters()</a> call that afterwards triggers all the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action">action</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Filter">filter</a> functions, previously hooked to that event using <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action">add_action()</a> or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter">add_filter()</a>, respectively.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ip-address">IP address</h2>



<p>An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique number (e.g. <em>70.84.29.148</em>)
assigned to a computer (or other internet-capable information appliance,
 such as a network printer) to enable it to communicate with other
devices using the <em>Internet Protocol</em>. It is a computer&#8217;s identity
on the internet, and every computer connected to the internet is
assigned at least one — although the methods of assigning these
addresses, and the permanence and duration of their assignment, differ
according to the use of the computer and the circumstances of its
internet use.
</p>



<p>Every <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server">web server</a> is assigned an IP address as well, but often times <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider">hosting providers</a>
 will assign multiple IP addresses to one computer, in the event that
multiple web sites reside on the same physical server. This is the case
with most inexpensive &#8216;managed&#8217; or &#8216;group&#8217; hosting packages.
</p>



<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Domain_name">Domain names</a>
 were created to provide an easier means of accessing internet resources
 than IP addresses, which are cumbersome to type and difficult to
remember. Every domain name has at least one corresponding IP address,
but only a small number of IP addresses have a domain name associated
with them, since only computers that are servers require domain names.
The domain name system (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#DNS">DNS</a>) is what maps domain names to IP addresses.

 JavaScript to move the comment form inside the comment you are replying
 to.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="meta">Meta</h2>



<p><strong>Meta</strong> has several meanings, but generally means <strong>information about</strong>.  In WordPress, <em>meta</em> usually refers to <strong>administrative</strong> type information.  As described in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Meta_Tags_in_WordPress">Meta Tags in WordPress</a>, <em>meta</em> is the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a> tag used to describe and define a web page to the outside world (search engines).  In the article <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section">Post Meta Data</a>, <em>meta</em> refers to information associated with each <strong>post</strong>, such as the author&#8217;s name and the date posted.  <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Meta_Rules">Meta Rules</a> define the general protocol to follow in using the Codex.  Also, many WordPress based sites offer a <em>Meta</em> section, usually found in the sidebar, with links to login or register at that site.  Finally, <em>Meta</em> is a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Namespace">namespace</a> that refers to administrative functions within Codex.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microformats">Microformats</h2>



<p><strong>Microformats</strong> provide a way for programs to read certain
information in web pages without making the pages look any different to
humans. They add semantics to the generic HTML markup in order for these
 programs to understand the meaning of specific parts of a web page
content which is better recognized by humans. For example, a web page
displaying a user&#8217;s profile could use microformats to make it easy for a
 program to extract the user&#8217;s contact information so that it can be
added to an address book in a single operation. In WordPress, some <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#theme">themes</a> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#plugin">plugins</a> support some microformats.

<p>A block that allows you to edit a site&#8217;s navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="network">Network</h2>



<p>In the WordPress user interface, a <strong>network</strong> is a collection of separate <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Site">sites</a> created in a single WordPress installation by the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite">multisite</a>
 feature. The sites in a WordPress network are not interconnected like
the things in other kinds of networks. They are very like the separate
blogs at WordPress.com.
</p>



<p>In WordPress code the network is known as the <em>site</em> and the sites are known as <em>blogs</em>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="news-reader">News reader</h2>



<p>A <strong>news aggregator</strong> or <strong>news (feed) reader</strong> is a computer program which tracks syndicated information <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Feed">feeds</a>, via <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS">RSS</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RDF">RDF</a>, or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Atom">Atom</a>.
 Most news aggregators allow one to &#8216;subscribe&#8217; to a feed, and
automatically keep track of the articles one has read, similar to an
email client tracking read emails.
</p>



<p>Many <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog">blogs</a> make their content available in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Feed">feed</a> form for the convenience of readers using news aggregators. WordPress can generate feeds in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS">RSS</a> and/or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Atom">Atom</a> formats.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nonce">Nonce</h2>



<p><strong>Nonce</strong> is used for security purposes to protect against
unexpected or duplicate requests that could cause undesired permanent or
 irreversible changes to the web site and particularly to its database.
Specifically, a nonce is an one-time token generated by a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_site">web site</a>
 to identify future requests to that web site. When a request is
submitted, the web site verifies if a previously generated nonce
expected for this particular kind of request was sent along and decides
whether the request can be safely processed, or a notice of failure
should be returned. This could prevent unwanted repeated, expired or
malicious requests from being processed.
</p>



<p>Nonce is usually included in a hidden HTML form field or as a
part of an URL and therefore sent with a request by submitting a form
field or visiting a link. If a request is not verified, the web site
could generate a new nonce in its response and prompt the user to
intentionally  confirm the repetition of the request. In WordPress, the
response message is <em>&#8220;Are you sure you want to do this?&#8221;</em> by default.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="page-post-type">Page (post type)</h2>



<p>A <strong>Page</strong> is often used to present &#8220;static&#8221; information about
yourself or your site.  A good example of a Page is information you
would place on an About Page.  A Page should not be confused with the
time-oriented objects called <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post">posts</a>.   Pages are typically &#8220;timeless&#8221; in nature and live &#8220;outside&#8221; your blog.
</p>



<p>The word &#8220;page&#8221; has long been used to describe any HTML document
on the web. In WordPress, however, &#8220;Page&#8221; refers to a very specific
feature first introduced in WordPress version 1.5.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="perl">Perl</h2>



<p><strong>Perl</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Practical Extraction and Report Language</strong>,
 but it&#8217;s most commonly spelled as a proper name. It&#8217;s a very popular
and powerful scripting language used for web applications, although its
use is being largely replaced by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP">PHP</a> in the mainstream. One of its strengths lies in its speedy and effective use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>. Its unofficial motto is, &#8220;There&#8217;s More Than One Way To Do It,&#8221; or &#8220;TMTOWTDI,&#8221; owing to the extreme flexibility of the syntax.
</p>



<p>WordPress does not use Perl, and it is therefore not required.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="permalink">Permalink</h2>



<p>A <strong>permalink</strong> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> at which a resource or article will be permanently stored. Many pages driven by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content_Management_System">Content Management Systems</a>
 contain excerpts of content which is frequently rotated, making linking
 to bits of information within them a game of chance. Permalinks allow
users to bookmark full articles at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> they know will never change, and will always present the same content.
</p>



<p>Permalinks are optional in WordPress, but are highly recommended as they greatly increase the cleanliness of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a>. WordPress uses the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache">Apache</a> module <em><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#mod_rewrite">mod_rewrite</a></em> to implement its permalink system.

&#8220;wp-content/plugins&#8221; directory on your webserver, where you have
installed WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should
be able to &#8220;turn it on&#8221; or Enable it from the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; page in the
administration interface of your weblog. The WordPress source code

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="post-type">Post Type</h2>



<p>Post type refers to the various structured data that is maintained in
 the WordPress posts table.  Native (or built-in) registered post types
are <strong>post</strong>, <strong>page</strong>, <strong>attachment</strong>, <strong>revision</strong>, and <strong>nav-menu-item</strong>.  Custom post types are also supported in WordPress and can be defined with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type">register_post_type()</a>.
  Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things
as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and
whatever a user or developer can imagine.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="query-block">Query Block</h2>



<p>A block that replicates the classic&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/">WP_Query</a>&nbsp;and allows for further customization with additional functionality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="query-string">Query String</h2>



<p>A sequence of codes in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</a> that a web page uses to determine what dynamic data to display. The query string in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>
 comes after an initial question mark, and may contain several
parameters separated by ampersands.  WordPress uses query strings to
indicate criteria to search for specific posts or sets of posts in the
database. The use of query strings is generally believed to impede the
indexing of dynamic pages by search engines. For this reason, it is
often desirable to use a method such as <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#mod_rewrite">mod_rewrite</a> to reduce exposure of query strings to search engines and other site visitors.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="query-variable">Query Variable</h2>



<p>A variable passed through the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Query_string">query string</a>. For example, in the query string <em>?category_name=tech&amp;feed=atom</em>, there are two query variables: <em>category_name</em> with a value of &#8220;tech&#8221;, and <em>feed</em> with a value of &#8220;atom&#8221;.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="quicktag">QuickTag</h2>



<p>A <strong>Quicktag</strong> is a shortcut, or one-click button, that inserts HTML code into your posts.  The &lt;em&gt; (emphasis) and &lt;/em&gt; (stop emphasis) HTML tags are example of Quicktags.  Some Quicktags, such as &lt;!&#8211;contactform&#8211;&gt;, insert HTML comment code that is used by plugins to replace text or perform certain actions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rdf">RDF</h2>



<p>Resource Description Framework. A language used to describe the  locations of resources on the web. WordPress can produce output in RDF  format that describes the locations of posts. Like <a href="#rss" data-type="internal">RSS</a>, RDF is used for  content syndication. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recordset">Recordset</h2>



<p><strong>Recordset</strong> refers to the group of records or result returned from a database query.

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="relative-path">Relative Path</h2>



<p>A <strong>relative path</strong> is the location of a file in relation to the
current working directory and does not begin with a slash (/).  This is
different from an <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Absolute_Path">absolute path</a> which gives an exact location.
</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="relative-uri">Relative URI</h2>



<p>A relative URI (sometimes called a <strong>relative link</strong>) is a partial URI that is interpreted (resolved) relative to a <strong>base URI</strong>.
</p>



<p>On the World Wide Web, relative URIs come in two forms:
</p>



<p>A <strong>relative URI with an absolute path</strong> is interpreted relative to the domain root:
</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> /images/icecream.jpg <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span> http://domain.example<strong>/images/icecream.jpg</strong>
</pre>



<p>A <strong>relative URI with a relative path</strong> is interpreted relative to the URL of the current document. E.g., on the web page <em>http://domain.example/icecream/chocolate.html</em>,
</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> <strong>strawberry.html</strong> <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span> http://domain.example/icecream/<strong>strawberry.html</strong>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reusable-block">RichText</h2>



<p>A common component enabling rich content editing including bold, italics, hyperlinks, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rss">RSS</h2>



<p>&#8220;<em>Really Simple Syndication</em>&#8220;: a format for syndicating many
types of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on
news-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site,
and is also known as a type of &#8220;feed&#8221; or &#8220;aggregator&#8221;.  An RSS feed can
contain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for
people to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner
(much like e-mail).
</p>



<p>The content of the feed can be read by using software called an <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#News_reader">RSS or Feed reader</a>.

Feed readers display hyperlinks, and include other metadata (information
 about information) that helps people decide whether they want to read
more, follow a link, or move on.
</p>



<p>The original intent of RSS is to make information come to you
(via the feed reader) instead of you going out to look for it (via the
Web).
</p>



<p>Programs called news aggregators permit users to view many feeds at once, providing &#8216;push&#8217; content constantly. See <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Category:Feeds">Category:Feeds</a> for Codex resources about bringing RSS feeds into WordPress.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="robots-txt">Robots.txt</h2>



<p>Web Robots are programs which traverse the Web automatically. They
are also called Web Wanderers, Web Crawlers, and Spiders. Search Engines
 are the main Web Robots.  Some Web Robots look for a file named <strong>robots.txt</strong> on your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server">web server</a> to see what and where they should look for content and files on your web server. Some Web Robots ignore this file.

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="role">Role</h2>



<p>A <strong>role</strong> gives users permission to perform a group of tasks. When a user logs in and is authenticated, the user&#8217;s role determines which <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Capabilities">capabilities</a>
 the user has, and each capability is permission to perform one or more
types of task. All users with the same role normally have the same
capabilities. For example, users who have the Author role usually have
permission to edit their own posts, but not permission to edit other
users&#8217; posts. WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities
 in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

The term &#8216;screen&#8217; is used to avoid confusion with &#8216;<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Page">page</a>&#8216;, which has a specific and different meaning in WordPress. For example, the web page used to manage posts is known as the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen">Posts Screen</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="settings-sidebar">Settings Sidebar</h2>



<p>The panel on the right that contains the document and block settings. The sidebar is toggled using the Settings gear icon. Block settings are shown when a block is selected, otherwise document settings are shown.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shell">Shell</h2>



<p>A <strong>shell</strong> is a program which interacts directly with an operating system such as MS-DOS, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix">Unix</a>/<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Mac_OS_X">Mac OS X</a>, or others — but it is most commonly associated with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix">Unices</a>.
 It is often referred to as a &#8216;console&#8217; or &#8216;command line&#8217;, because it is
 controlled using typed commands rather than mouse or graphical
interface input.
</p>



<p>Most often, when interacting with a remote computer (as one would
 when configuring WordPress), an additional &#8220;faux&#8221; shell is involved
called <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#SSH">SSH</a>.
</p>



<p>Some popular shell programs are:
</p>

</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sidebar">Sidebar</h2>



<p>A <strong>sidebar</strong> is a vertical column provided by a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Theme">theme</a> for displaying information other than the main <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content">content</a> of the web page. Themes usually provide at least one sidebar at the left or right of the content. Sidebars usually contain <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Widget">widgets</a> that an administrator of the site can customize.
</p>



<p>In a theme, sidebars are generated by a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Template">template</a> file, typically named <em>sidebar.php</em>.
</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="site">Site</h2>



<p>In the WordPress user interface, a <strong>site</strong> can simply be the website created by WordPress, or it can be a virtual website created as part of a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Network">network</a> by the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite">multisite</a>
 feature. A site in a network is virtual in the sense that it does not
have its own directory on the server, although it has its own URL and it
 might have its own domain name.
</p>



<p>In WordPress code the site is the website created by WordPress.
If multisite is in use, then the site is the network website and each
virtual website is known as a <em>blog</em>.

<p>The cohesive experience that allows you to directly edit and navigate between various templates, template parts, styling options, and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="slug">Slug</h2>



<p>A <strong>slug</strong> is a few words that describe a post or a page. Slugs
are usually a URL friendly version of the post title (which has been
automatically generated by WordPress), but a slug can be anything you
like.  Slugs are meant to be used with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Permalink">permalinks</a> as they help describe what the content at the URL is.
</p>



<p>Example post permalink: <em><a href="https://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/">https://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/</a></em>
</p>



<p>The slug for that post is &#8220;wordpress-203&#8221;.
</p>



<p>Slugs are also used for post types, categories, tags, etc. Like
post and page slugs, this is usually for creating URL friendly versions
of these items.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="smileys">Smileys</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/File:icon_wink.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://codex.wordpress.org/images/4/4b/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink Icon" /></a></figure>



<p>Smileys (also called Smilies or Emoticons) are stylized
representations of a human face, usually displayed as yellow buttons
with two dots for the eyes, and a half mouth. Smileys are often used in
WordPress Plugins.  By default, WordPress automatically converts text
smileys to graphic images. When you type <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> in your post you see  when you preview or publish your post.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="spam">Spam</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, <a href="http://www.hormel.com">SPAM</a>
 was an animal by-product that came in a can and was fodder for many
Monty Python sketches, but since the world-wide adoption of the internet
 as an integral part of daily life, Spam has become synonymous with what
 is wrong with the internet. Spam, in general terms, is an email or
other forms of unsolicited advertising. Spam is very easy to spread
throughout the internet, and works on the principle that if you send out
 thousands, or hundreds of thousands of unsolicited advertisements,
scams, or other questionable methods of making money, that you only need
 a very small percentage of people to be fooled and you will make lots
of money.
</p>



<p>Common spam these days comes from online gambling sites and those
 trying to sell drugs for &#8220;male enhancement.&#8221; Lately, web logs, or
blogs, as we call them, have been targeted by spammers to try to
increase their site ratings in the search engines. Spammers use various
methods to distribute their electronic junk mail, and employ bots, or
computer programs to quickly and easily send email or comments to
millions of addresses and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address">IPs</a> all over the world.
</p>



<p>Spammers can be difficult to track down as they often hijack peoples&#8217; email and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address">IP</a> addresses. When this happens, it may appear a friend sent you the spam, but in fact, the spammer&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot">bot</a> grabbed your friend&#8217;s email address and used it to hide the true source of the spam. WordPress <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Developer">developers</a> and community members are constantly working on more and better ways to combat these annoying <strong>spammers</strong>
 as they clog the internet with their garbage. You can help by offering
your talents, ideas, suggestions, or just by being vigilant and
installing any of the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam">currently-available spam combating tools</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tag">Tag</h2>



<p>A Tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category">Category</a>,
 but smaller in scope. A Post may have several tags, many of which
relate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked
 to a page which shows all Posts having the same Tag. Tags can be
created on-the-fly by simply typing them into the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts#Post_Tags">Tag field</a>. By default, tags can be assigned only to the <em>Post</em> and custom <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_types">post types</a>.
</p>



<p>Tags can also be displayed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_Cloud">clouds</a>
 which show large numbers of Tags in various sizes, colors, etc. This
allows for a sort of total perspective on the blog, allowing people to
see the sort of things your blog is about most.
</p>



<p>Many people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is
easy: Categories generally don&#8217;t change often, while your Tags usually
change with every Post and are closer to the topic of the Post.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tagline">Tagline</h2>



<p>A tagline is a catchy phrase that describes the character or the
attributes of the blog in a brief, concise manner. Think of it as the
slogan, or catchline for a weblog.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="task-based-documentation">Task Based Documentation</h2>



<p>Task based, or task oriented documentation is writing that takes you
through a process/task step-by-step; it is succinct, lacks jargon, is
easily understood, and structured entirely around performing specific
tasks.

In order to get to Z, you need to:
</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Step x</li>



<li>Step y</li>



<li>Step z</li>
</ol>



<p>Keep in mind that people who need to know how to perform a task usually need answers quick!
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>



<p>A <strong>taxonomy</strong> allows for the classification of things.  In
WordPress, there are two built-in taxonomies, categories and tags.
These taxonomies help further classify posts and custom post types.
Also, custom taxonomies can be defined.

For example, there is typically a template for the header area at the top of the web pages, a template for the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content">content</a>, a template for the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Sidebar">sidebars</a>, and so on. The templates are like building blocks that make up the complete web page.

<p>A scaled down direct editing experience allowing you to edit/change/create the template a post/page uses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="template-tag">Template Tag</h2>



<p>In a WordPress Theme, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags">template tags</a>
 are used in template files to generate specific programming
instructions. They are used to display generated content and information
 on a WordPress site. Template tags are short programming words, also
known as functions, that tap into the WordPress core for instructions.
For example, the HTML title tag of a WordPress site may hold the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/bloginfo">bloginfo()</a>
 template tag that requests the site title, site tagline, and other site
 information set by the template tag parameters. Using this in the title HTML tag allows the Theme to be used on multiple sites and the information displayed will change easily with each site.
</p>



<p>Other template tags are more sophisticated, generating post content, queries, and site data.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="term">Term</h2>



<p>In WordPress, a <strong>term</strong> is a classification, group or subset of a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Taxonomy">Taxonomy</a>, where the latter can be a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category">Category</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Tag">Tag</a>
 or Custom Taxonomy. By default, terms have a title, a slug and a
description. Hierarchical taxonomies like categories can define a parent
 term.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="text-editor">Text editor</h2>



<p>A <strong>text editor</strong> is a program which edits files in <em>plain text</em> format, as compared to <em>binary</em> format.  Using a non-text based word processing program (e.g. using Microsoft Word to edit <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP">PHP</a>
 scripts) can cause major problems in your code. This is because
non-text based word processing programs insert extra formatting into
text files, and can corrupt the files when they need to be interpreted
by the interpreter. An editor like Notepad does not insert any extra
formatting.
</p>



<p><strong>Edit WordPress Files with a text only editor.</strong>
</p>



<p>Some examples of file formats which need to be edited as plain text:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a> documents</li>



<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP">PHP</a> scripts</li>

<li> Rich Text Format documents</li>



<li> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#JavaScript">JavaScript</a> scripts</li>
</ul>



<p>For our recommended Text Editors, please see <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/editing-files/#text-editors">Editing Files</a>.</p>



<p>Some examples of non-plain text formats that require special software for editing:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Microsoft Word documents</li>



<li> Microsoft Excel spreadsheets</li>



<li> Images, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF</li>
</ul>



<p>Some examples of software which can edit text, but which are <strong>NOT</strong> regarded as basic text editors and <strong>NOT recommended</strong> for use on WordPress files:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Microsoft Word</li>



<li> Microsoft Excel</li>



<li> Adobe Photoshop</li>



<li> Adobe Illustrator</li>



<li> Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="theme">Theme</h2>



<p>A Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a
graphical front-end interface with an underlying unifying design for a
site. A WordPress Theme modifies the way the site is displayed and
designed, without modifying the underlying core programming of
WordPress. While some associate a WordPress Theme with &#8220;skinning&#8221; your
site with a design, a WordPress Theme contains programming code that
influences the design, changing it with each generated page view based
upon the programming with PHP, WordPress template tags, WordPress
conditional tags, and CSS.

<p>Trackback helps you to notify another author that you wrote something
 related to what he had written on his blog, even if you don&#8217;t have an
explicit link to his article. This improves the chances of the other
author sitting up and noticing that you gave him credit for something,
or that you improved upon something he wrote, or something similar. With
 pingback and trackback, blogs are interconnected. Think of them as the
equivalents of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic
 paper, or a chapter in a textbook.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unicode">Unicode</h2>



<p>A widely supported and preferred character encoding system.
</p>



<p>For a computer to display letters (or any text characters), it
needs to enumerate them &#8211; create an index of characters it knows how to
display. These indexes are known as character sets. This is invaluable
for users hosting <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Localization">WordPress in a non-English language</a>.
</p>



<p>The most widely used collections of these character sets are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859">iso-8859</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1">iso-8859-1</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-15">iso-8859-15</a>  (which contains the euro sign) being the most common; they are also known as  Latin1 and Latin9. These character sets use 8 bits (a single byte) for  each character, allowing for 255 different characters (256, counting  null). However, when considering that Latin-based languages aren&#8217;t the  only ones in the world (think Japanese or Hebrew), 255 characters aren&#8217;t  nearly enough. </p>



<p>There is a wide index of characters known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>.
 Unicode has so many characters that sometimes more than 16 bits (2
bytes!) are required to represent them. Furthermore, the first 127
characters of Unicode are the same as the first 127 of the most widely
used character set &#8211; iso-8859-1. For this purpose, UTF, the Unicode
Translation Format, was created. UTF uses different numbers of bits for
characters, and allows for the entire range of Unicode to be used. What
you should probably know is:
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> UTF-8 is an 8-bit-minimum type of UTF. There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32.</li>



<li> If your document is in a Latin-based encoding, you probably don&#8217;t need to change anything about it for it to be UTF.</li>



<li> A single UTF document can be in various languages with no need to switch encodings halfway through.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unix">Unix</h2>



<p><strong>Unix</strong>, or <strong>UNIX</strong>, is a computer operating system developed
 at AT&amp;T&#8217;s Bell Laboratories starting back in 1969. Initially
designed with the objective of creating an OS written in a high level
language rather than assembly, a majority of <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server">web servers</a> currently run on different &#8220;flavors&#8221; of this high-performance OS, or on <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux">Linux</a>, developed as a Unix-like operating system.

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unix-time">Unix Time</h2>



<p><strong>Unix Time</strong>, or a <strong>timestamp</strong>, is a method of tracking time
 by determining the approximate number of seconds from a particular
event. That event is called an Epoch. Since this time format is only off
 by a few seconds each century, it is usually considered good enough for
 most applications.
</p>



<p>Unix time is (currently) a ten digit number, and looks like this: 1229362315.
 WordPress often uses a Unix timestamp internally to track time. The
human readable times and dates you see are converted from Unix Time or
from a MySQL/MariaDB DATETIME field.

</p>



<p>It is possible to create one&#8217;s own web server, hosted on any
speed of internet connection, but many people choose to purchase

<p>In WordPress a <strong>widget</strong> is a self-contained area of a web page
that performs a specific function, or the code that generates such a
self-contained area. For example, WordPress has a built-in widget that
displays a list of pages in a weblog&#8217;s <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Sidebar">sidebar</a>, and it has another built-in widget that displays a list of recent comments in the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Dashboard">Dashboard</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="xml">XML</h2>



<p><strong>XML</strong>, or <strong>Extensible Markup Language</strong>, is written in
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and essentially allows you
to define your own markup language.  XML is extremely useful in
describing, sharing, and transmitting data across the Internet.
Typically used in conjunction with <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a>, XML defines data and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML">HTML</a> displays that data.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Terminology Introduction</h2>



<p>The developers created WordPress as a <strong>weblogging</strong> &nbsp;(<a href="/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/">blogging</a>) system. A <a href="/support/article/glossary#blog">blog</a>, as defined in the <a href="/support/article/glossary">Codex Glossary</a>, is “an online journal, diary, or serial, published by a person or group of people”. Many <em>blogs</em> are personal in nature, reflecting the opinions and interests of the owner. But, <em>blogs</em> are now important tools in the world of news, business, politics, and entertainment. </p>



<p><em>Blogs</em> are a form of a <a href="/support/article/glossary#content-management-system">Content Management System (CMS)</a>, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Wikipedia</a> calls &#8220;a system used to organize and facilitate collaborative content creation.&#8221; Both <em>blogs</em> and <em>Content Management Systems</em> can perform the role of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> (<strong>site</strong> for short). A <em>website</em> can be thought of as a collection of articles and information about a specific subject, service, or product, which may not be a personal reflection of the owner. More recently, as the role of WordPress has expanded, WordPress developers have begun using the more general term <strong>site</strong>, in place of blog.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Content Terminology</h3>



<p>The term <strong>Word</strong> in WordPress refers to the words used to compose <a href="/support/article/glossary/#post">posts</a>. <em>Posts</em> are the principal element (or <a href="/support/article/glossary#content">content</a>) of a blog. The <em>posts</em> are the writings, compositions, discussions, discourses, musings, and, yes, the rantings of the blog&#8217;s owner and guest authors. <em>Posts</em>, in most cases, are the reason a blog exists; without <em>posts</em>, there is no blog! </p>



<p>Integral to a blog are the pictures, images, sounds, and movies, otherwise know as <a href="/support/article/media-library-screen/">media</a>. <em>Media</em> enhances, and gives life to a blog&#8217;s content. WordPress provides an easy to use method of inserting <em>Media</em> directly into posts, and a method to <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Add_New_SubPanel">upload Media</a> that can be later attached to posts, and a <a href="/support/article/media-library-screen/">Media Library</a> to manage those various <em>Media</em>. </p>



<p>An important part of the <a href="/support/article/writing-posts/">posting</a> process is the act of assigning those posts to <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel">categories</a>. Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more <em>categories</em>. <em>Categories</em> can be hierarchical in nature, where one category acts as a parent to several child, or grandchild, categories. Thoughtful <em>categorization</em> allows posts of similar content to be grouped, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation, and use of a site. In addition to categories, terms or keywords called <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Tags_SubPanel">tags</a> can be assigned to each post. <em>Tags</em> act as another navigation tool, but are not hierarchical in nature. Both categories and tags are part of a system called <a href="/support/article/glossary#taxonomy">taxonomies</a>. If categories and tags are not enough, users can also create <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy">custom taxonomies</a> that allow more specific identification of posts or pages or <a href="/support/article/glossary#post-type">custom post types</a>. </p>



<p>In turn, post categories and tags are two of the elements of what&#8217;s called <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section">post meta data</a>. <em>Post meta data</em> refers to the information associated with each post and includes the author&#8217;s name and the date posted as well as the post categories. <em>Post meta data</em> also refers to <a href="/support/article/custom-fields/">Custom Fields</a> where you assign specific words, or keys, that can describe posts. But, you can&#8217;t mention <em>post meta data</em> without discussing the term <strong>meta</strong>. </p>



<p>Generally, <a href="/support/article/glossary#meta">meta</a> means <strong>&#8220;information
about&#8221;</strong>; in WordPress, <em>meta</em> usually refers to <strong>administrative</strong>-type
information. So, besides <em>post meta data</em>, <em>Meta</em> is the <a href="/support/article/glossary#html">HTML</a> tag used to describe
and define a web page to the outside world, like <em>meta tag keywords</em> for
search engines. Also, many WordPress-based sites offer a <em>Meta</em> section,
usually found in the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_Your_Sidebar">sidebar</a>, with links to login or register at that site. And,
don&#8217;t forget <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Meta_Rules">Meta Rules</a>: The rules defining the general protocol to follow in
using this Codex, or <em>Meta,</em> as in the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Namespace">namespace</a> that refers to
administrative functions within Codex. That&#8217;s a lot of <em>Meta</em>! </p>

is made public, a blog&#8217;s readers will respond, via <a href="/support/article/glossary#comments">comments</a>, to that post, and in
turn, authors will reply. <em>Comments</em> enable the communication process,
that give-and-take, between author and reader. <em>Comments</em> are the
life-blood of most blogs. </p>



<p>Finally, WordPress also offers two other <a href="/support/article/glossary#content-management-system">content management tools</a> called <a href="/support/article/pages">Pages</a> and <a href="/support/article/glossary#post-type">custom post types</a>. <em>Pages</em> often present static information, such as &#8220;About Me&#8221;, or &#8220;Contact Us&#8221;, <em>Pages</em>. Typically &#8220;timeless&#8221; in nature, <em>Pages</em> should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called <em>posts</em>. Interestingly, a <em>Page</em> is allowed to be <a href="/support/article/glossary#comments">commented upon</a>, but a <em>Page</em> cannot be <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel">categorized</a>. A <a href="/support/article/glossary#post-type">custom post type</a> refers to a type of structured data that is different from a post or a page. Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Design Terminology </h3>



<p>A <em>WordPress
Theme</em> is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and
text. A <em>Theme</em> is sometimes called the <strong>skin</strong> or template, but it
isn&#8217;t really. A skin and template are really website paint jobs. A WordPress
Theme is where code meets design, allowing a site to change based upon specific
conditions set by the site administrator. </p>



<p>Installation of WordPress Themes is made easy with the <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/#themes">Themes Menu</a> on the Administration Screens. Simply search for a new Theme from within the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">official WordPress Theme Directory</a> and activate it with a few clicks. You can also preview your site before installing and activating the Theme to see what your site will look like with that WordPress Theme. </p>



<p>The <em>flexibility</em> of WordPress is apparent when discussing terminology related to the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout">design</a> of a WordPress site. At the core of WordPress, developers created a programming structure named <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a> to handle the processing of posts. <em>The Loop</em> is the critical <a href="/support/article/glossary#php">PHP</a> program code used to display <em>posts</em>. Anyone wanting to enhance and <strong>customize</strong> WordPress will need to understand <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/">the mechanics of </a><em><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a></em>. </p>



<p>Along with The Loop, WordPress developers have created <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/">Template Tags</a> which are a group of PHP functions that can be invoked by designers to perform an action or display specific information. It is the <em>Template Tags</em> that form the basis of the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/">Template</a> Files. <em>Templates (files)</em> contain the programming pieces, such as <em>Template Tags</em>, that control the structure and flow of a WordPress site. These files draw information from your WordPress <a href="/support/article/glossary#mysql">MySQL</a> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description">database</a> and generate the <a href="/support/article/glossary#html">HTML</a> code which is sent to the web browser. A <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/">Template Hierarchy</a>, in essence the order of processing, dictates how <em>Templates</em> control almost all aspects of the output, including <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-headers/">Headers</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/sidebars/">Sidebars</a>, and <a href="/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#archives">Archives</a>. <em>Archives</em> are a dynamically generated list of posts, and are typically grouped by <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index">date</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/taxonomy-templates/#category">category</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Tag_Templates">tag</a>, or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates">author</a>. </p>



<p>As the
capabilities of WordPress have improved, developers have added tools that allow
users to easily manage a site&#8217;s look and functionality: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Widgets</strong> provide an easy way to add little programs, such as the current weather, to a sidebar. </li><li><strong>Menus</strong> make it easy to define the navigation buttons that are typically present near the top of a site&#8217;s pages. </li><li>The <strong>Background</strong> tool allows the user to change the background image and color of a site.</li><li>The <strong>Header</strong> tool gives the user control of the images displayed at the top of a site&#8217;s various pages.      </li><li><a href="/support/article/post-formats/">Post Formats</a> allow the user to control the display of a specific post (i.e. display this post as an Aside or as a quote or as a gallery). </li></ul>



<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">Plug</a><a href="/support/article/plugins">i</a><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">ns</a> are custom functions created to extend the core functionality of WordPress. The WordPress developers have maximized flexibility and minimized code bloat by allowing outside developers the opportunity to create their own useful add-on features. As evidenced by the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress Plugin Directory</a>, there&#8217;s a <em>Plugin</em> to enhance virtually every aspect of WordPress. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Add_New_SubPanel">Plugin management tool</a> makes it extremely easy
to find and install Plugins directly from the official directory. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Administrative Terminology</h3>



<p>Another set of terms to examine are those involving the <a href="/support/article/administering-your-blog/">Administration</a> of a WordPress site. A comprehensive set of <a href="/support/article/administration-screens/">Administration Screens</a> enables users to <strong>easily</strong> administer and monitor their blog. A WordPress administrator has a number of powers which include requiring a visitor to register in order to participate in the blog, who can create new posts, whether comments can be left, and if files can be uploaded to the blog. </p>



<p>Some of the main administrative responsibilities of a WordPress blog involve adding, deleting, and managing <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Registered_User_Features">Registered Users</a>. Administering users means controlling <a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/">Roles and Capabilities</a>, or permissions. <strong>Roles</strong> control what functions a registered <em>user</em> can perform as those functions can range from just being able to login at a blog to performing the role administrator. </p>



<p>Another chief concern for the blog administrator is <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation">Comment Moderation</a>. <a href="/support/article/glossary#comments">Comments</a>, also called <a href="/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/">discussions</a>, are responses to posts left for the post author by the visitor and represent an important part of &#8220;the give and take&#8221; of a blog. But <em>Comments</em> must be <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam">patrolled</a> for <a href="/support/article/glossary#spam">Spam</a> and other malicious intentions. The WordPress Administration <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Comments_SubPanel">Comments Screen</a> simplifies that process with easy-to-use screens which add, change, and delete Comments. </p>



<p>And not to be forgotten is the obligation for an administrator to keep their WordPress current to insure that the latest features, bugs, and security fixes are in effect. To accommodate administrators, WordPress has a simple <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Upgrade_SubPanel">Upgrade Screen</a> to download and install the latest version of WordPress. There&#8217;s no excuse to not upgrade! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help Terminology </h3>



<p>The final set of <em>jargon</em> relates to <strong>helping</strong> you with WordPress. First and foremost is the hanging Help tab that is displayed under each of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/#help">Administration Screens</a>. That contextual help describes the function and use of the current screen and provides links to other help topics. And, there are other <em>help</em> resources available to WordPress users; <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_WordPress_Help">Finding WordPress Help</a>, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>, and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ">WordPress FAQ (frequently asked questions)</a> are good starting points. Also <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress">Getting Started with WordPress</a> will <strong>jump-start</strong> readers into the world of WordPress and the excellent <a href="/support/article/wordpress-lessons/">WordPress Lessons</a> provide in-depth <strong>tutorials</strong> on many of the aspects of using WordPress. Among the most important resources is the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_Support_Forums">WordPress Support Forum</a> where <strong>knowledgeable</strong> volunteers answer your questions and help solve any problems related to WordPress. And, of course, this Support site which is filled with hundreds of articles designed to make your WordPress experience a success! </p>
