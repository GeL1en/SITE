<p>Disney is an iconic premier brand that is influential in the creative content and entertainment industries. Known worldwide for its films, TV shows, music, and full-scale experiences—from theme parks to cruise ships—it has developed a legacy of delighting audiences for over a century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Disney General Entertainment Press (DGE Press) website focuses on Disney’s television brands and is built to communicate what’s happening across its various creative properties. The site is simple and clean, letting visitors find the content they need quickly and browse through press releases and updates just as easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disney needed a content platform that could unite multiple network sites into a cohesive editorial workflow with integrated asset management. With WordPress, the DGE Press team was able to streamline content updates for 8,000 press members. The result is an 8X improvement in editorial velocity and improved both asset security and embargoed content distribution.</p>
